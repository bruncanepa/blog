For me, the learning process involves applying what you learn through action.

Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m excited to share that I've developed an open-source library that simplifies the integration of End-to-End Encryption (**E2EE**) into Web apps.

After exploring the realm of E2EE, I made this tool using \#OpenPGP and the \#WebCryptoAPI, inspired by the robust security practices of **\#ProtonMail** by [**Proton | Privacy by Default**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/protonprivacy/).

Check out the code [here](https://bit.ly/3R442bi). More features will come in the near future.
