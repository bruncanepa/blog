# How E2EE in **\#ProtonMail** (by [**Proton | Privacy by Default**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#)) works: a simplified version

End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) makes sure that your messages are super secure and private. Imagine it's like sending a letter in a locked box, and only the the recipient can unlock it. ✉️ 📦

ProtonMail takes two crucial steps to do this:

1. When you sign up, they create a key pair (super long random texts). A public key for locking and a private key for unlocking your messages. The public key it’s shared with your contacts, but the private key is your top-secret key and is not shared.

   To communicate with another user you use their public key, that their shared with you, to lock the data you want to send them. Then they use their private key to unlock it and read it.

2. To ensure your private key can’t be read by nobody (even by Proton), it's locked with your password and then sent to ProtonMail servers. This is made so everytime you log in you can unlock it with your password, and then use it to unlock all your emails.

This way, your private key is always yours, and your messages remain super safe. 📩🔒
