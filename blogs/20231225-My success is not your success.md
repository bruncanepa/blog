# My success is not your success

What does '**success**' mean to you?
A trophy, money, social media followers, belongings, degree, or job?

**Success varies for everyone**. We often compare ourselves based on societal standards, feeling happy if we meet them and like failures if we don't.

These standards focuses on outcomes.
When success is seen as an outcome, we tie ourselves to an imaginary future, **losing the joy of the present**.

**Happiness is our natural state**. It emerges when we stop chasing and **find** **peace in the present moment**.

True success lies in **defining it for ourselves**, letting go of societal pressures, and finding happiness in the now.

For me, success is feeling proud of myself in every moment. This keeps me present, focused, and grateful for the little things.

How do you define success now?
