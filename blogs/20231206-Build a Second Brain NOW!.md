# Build a Second Brain NOW!

A Second Brain ðŸ§  is a personalized digital system that acts as an extension of your mind, offering a structured approach to collecting and accessing ideas, notes, and important data.

Why I bring this? Because I read a lot. The problem is that we (or maybe just me) forget most of the things we read.

So I've tried out all kinds of tools to build my Second Brain. The one I always stick with is a simple doc with links to the blog and itâ€™s main ideas.

This is just a little preview of my actual Second Brain, Iâ€™ve added only information about individual excellence and leadership https://bit.ly/bc-second-brain.

Hope it can help someone to start theirs.
