# The hidden costs of new technologies

As Software Engineers, our love for cutting-edge technologies is real, but it's crucial to **weigh the hidden costs**.
Consider factors like technology age, open-source nature, community support, stability, bugs, maintenance costs, hiring ease, and corporate backing.

Embrace the '**Boring First**' concept: opt for new technologies only when they solve a problem your current stack can't.
When trying something new, write down clear reasons to uncover potential drawbacks.

To prevent overuse, introduce '**innovation tokens**'â€”set a limit and deduct one with each new technology adoption. This ensures a thoughtful and intentional approach to innovation.

What's your approach?
