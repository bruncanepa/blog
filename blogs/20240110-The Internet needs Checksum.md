# The Internet needs Checksum
I explain it here why ⬇️

🔍 A Checksum is a **unique digital fingerprint** obtained as result of processing a piece of data through a **cryptographic algorithm**. So it can be easily identified and compared.

Two examples on how that it helps:

🔐 **Security and data integrity**: when you share or download a file, compare the checksum of the sender's file with that of the recipient to ensure it hasn't been modified.

🔄 **Caching**: compare files Checksum to know if stored content are valid or needs an update. This allows to have the latest and correct information.
