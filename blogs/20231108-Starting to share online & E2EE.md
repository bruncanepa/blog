# Starting to share online & E2EE

Just finished 'Show Your Work' by Austin Kleon, reigniting my passion for learning and sharing. As a Privacy Enthusiast for 5+ years, I've advocated for privacy and essential tools to use. Now, I'm on a journey to dive into End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) to build new things and to contribute to the community.

I'm beginning with understanding how [Proton | Privacy by Default](https://www.linkedin.com/company/protonprivacy/) and [Standard Notes](https://www.linkedin.com/company/standard-notes/) E2EE implementations work.

I believe knowledge sharing is key to progress, and I'm excited to contribute to the world of privacy and security in the future. üåêüîê

Special thanks to [Marc Lou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABcW3PUBYVoeBRjMdyt4xj4PXkhDxTBFGs4) for inspire me to build in public.
