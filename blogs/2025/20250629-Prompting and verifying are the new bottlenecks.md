# Prompting and verifying are the new bottlenecks

For the past 7 months I’ve been using DevinAI to handle most of my coding tasks and this is what stands out:

- Prompting LLMs and integrating them into software takes most of my time, even with help from tools like Cursor.

- Reviewing and testing what DevinAI produces has now become a bottleneck in my workflow. There are always 3-4 PRs ready just waiting for me.

I heard that "AI excels middle-to-middle, not end-to-end".

I couldn't agree more with this, as full delegation for these two tasks to AI isn’t yet possible.

**Coding is not the bottleneck anymore, refining prompts and ensuring AI outputs quality are.**
