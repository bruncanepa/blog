# Web General Tips for extra Privacy

Are you worried about all the data that most companies are collecting about us online?

Here are 6 tips to increase your privacy online that you probably don't know...ðŸ‘‡

1/6 Change your Web Browser

Try to change it on [desktop](https://www.notion.so/6af86ffee3f94ac5b84601d827f67a67?pvs=21) and [mobile](https://www.notion.so/6af86ffee3f94ac5b84601d827f67a67?pvs=21) .

These are open source and privacy focused:

- Brave Browser (desktop and mobile).
- Mozilla Firefox (desktop and mobile).
- DuckDuckGo (macOS and mobile).

2/6 Change your Search Engine

These have no logs and no tracking policies and at least some open source code:

- Ecosia
- DuckDuckGo
- StartPage
- Brave Search

3/6 Install Privacy focused Web Browser extensions

Read my other blog [Browser Extensions for Privacy](<20220427-Browser Extensions for Privacy.md>).

4/6 Change your messaging app

These are open source and use end-to-end encryption:

- Signal
- Session
- Threema

5/6 Change your email app

These uses Zero Access Knowledge and end-to-end encryption:

- ProtonMail
- Tutanota

6/6 Encrypt your DNS look ups

Use a VPN or DNS resolver with DNS over HTTPS with no logs policies and that doesn't sell your data:

- ProtonVPN
- Cloudflare 1.1.1.1
