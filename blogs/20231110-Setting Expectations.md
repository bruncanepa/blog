# Setting Expectations

This year, my biggest learning as a leader has been about SETTING BETTER EXPECTATIONS.  
I discovered that most performance problems arise from a lack of clarity about what is expected. People either fail to do what they should or end up doing things they shouldn't.

Consider creating co-authored expectations with your team, this can greatly enhance alignment and accountability from both sides.
