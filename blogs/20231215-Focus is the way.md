# Focus is the way 🎯 🛤️

I feel in my flow and highly focused 🎯 when engaged in activities that I find fun, challenging, or scary.

These activities allow me to fully immerse myself in the present moment, with no unrelated thoughts or worries. It's just me enjoying the experience.

This year, I started practicing surf-skating 🛹. It's incredibly fun and filled with challenges, especially for someone like me who has never been on a skateboard before. But above all, it's extremely scary. Every time I attempt to land a new trick, I find myself battling with my own fears. If I'm not fully present in the moment, I will likely fall and get hurt 🤕.

I encourage everyone to pursue these types of activities in your own life whenever possible.

In a world full of distractions, focus is the way 🛣️.
