# Elevating Your Impact - a Principle for Software Engineers

As a Software Engineer, always focus on the impact your work has on the business.

If there was no business, your job wouldn't exist. So stop caring only about the technical side, and also worry about the value you provide.

Try changing your mindset from working on many features as possible, to working on the most impactful features.

This will elevate your impact and bring new opportunities to grow faster and go up on the career ladder.
